# RapGeneratorJava
I rewrote my Rap generator PHP program with Java and the console.
I also fixed several grammatical errors.
I created loops to make sure that you're entering age correctly, as an integer 
and also that you are entering gender correctly as m/f (not case sensitive)
I still want to add functionality to this application such as being able to save and read specific generated raps
